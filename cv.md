## About myself:

### My name is Vita and I am 18 years old. 
### I am a beginner frontend developer. Interest in the field of programming appeared a year ago, so I entered the university with a degree in information technology software. 

### After a year, I realized that most of the disciplines I highlight and are interested in computer markup languages. Therefore, having successfully closed the session, I want to take the course so as not to stand still, consolidate my knowledge and catch a lot of new information.

### Now I donâ€™t have many skills, basic knowledge of figma, and so proactive in building multi-page sites. But I want to do something more serious, so let's go.
